Atomic File Write Utilities
============================

Synchronous utilities for atomic file writes to prevent corruption.

Uses temp file + os.replace() pattern which is atomic on POSIX systems
and atomic on Windows when source and destination are on the same volume.

Usage:
    from core.file_utils import write_json_atomic

    write_json_atomic("/path/to/file.json", {"key": "value"})

    Atomic file write using temp file and rename.

    Writes to .tmp file first, then atomically replaces target file
    using os.replace() which is atomic on POSIX systems and same-volume Windows.

    Note: This function supports both text and binary modes. For binary modes
    (mode containing 'b'), encoding must be None.

    Args:
        filepath: Target file path
        mode: File open mode (default: "w", text mode only)
        encoding: File encoding for text modes, None for binary (default: "utf-8")

    Example:
        with atomic_write("/path/to/file.json") as f:
            json.dump(data, f)
