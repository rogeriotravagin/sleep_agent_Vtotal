## Journey & Lifecycle Frameworks

### Lincoln Murphy: Customer Success Framework

**Core Concepts:**
- **Desired Outcome:** What the customer ultimately wants to achieve (not just product usage)
- **Appropriate Experience:** The journey that gets them there
- **Success Milestones:** Measurable checkpoints along the way

**Application in Edtech B2C:**
- Desired Outcome = Personal transformation (new skill, career change, business launch)
- Appropriate Experience = Learning journey adapted to student context
- Success Milestones = Not course completion, but real-world application

**When to use:** Defining what success means for students, designing onboarding.

### AARRR (Pirate Metrics)

**Stages:**
1. **Acquisition:** How students find you
2. **Activation:** First value experience (Aha Moment)
3. **Retention:** Continued engagement
4. **Revenue:** Renewals, upsells
5. **Referral:** Word of mouth, testimonials

**Application in Edtech B2C:**
- Focus heavily on Activation (7-day window critical)
- Retention = engagement, not just non-cancellation
- Referral happens at peak positive emotion (success moment)

**When to use:** Building funnel metrics, identifying leaky stages.

---

### Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)

**Core Concept:**
People "hire" products to make progress in their lives.

**Three Job Dimensions:**
1. **Functional:** What task needs to be done
2. **Emotional:** How they want to feel
3. **Social:** How they want to be perceived

**Application in Edtech B2C:**
- Functional: "Learn to use AI for my business"
- Emotional: "Feel confident and capable"
- Social: "Be seen as innovative, ahead of the curve"

**When to use:** Understanding student motivations, crafting messaging.

---

### Time to First Value (TTFV)

**Definition:**
The time between signup and experiencing meaningful value.

**In Edtech B2C:**
- Not just first login
- Not just first lesson
- First moment of "this is worth it"

**Benchmark:** < 48 hours for most products

**How to reduce TTFV:**
1. Remove friction from first login
2. Guide to quick win immediately
3. Celebrate first achievement
4. Connect to desired outcome

**When to use:** Optimizing onboarding, reducing early churn.

## Health Score & Prediction Frameworks

### Customer Health Score

**Definition:**
Composite metric predicting likelihood of success/renewal.

**Typical Dimensions for Edtech:**

| Dimension | Weight | What it measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Engagement | 40% | Active participation |
| Progress | 35% | Learning advancement |
| Sentiment | 25% | Satisfaction, connection |

**Action Triggers:**

| Score | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 80-100 | Champion | Advocacy programs |
| 60-79 | Healthy | Standard nurturing |
| 40-59 | At Risk | Proactive intervention |
| 0-39 | Critical | Immediate personal contact |

**When to use:** Prioritizing CS resources, predicting churn.

---

### Leading vs Lagging Indicators

**Leading Indicators:**
- Predict future outcomes
- Actionable (can change the outcome)
- Examples: Login frequency drop, progress stall, community absence

**Lagging Indicators:**
- Measure past results
- Hard to change after the fact
- Examples: Churn rate, completion rate, NPS

**In Edtech B2C:**
| Leading (Act on these) | Lagging (Measure these) |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| 3+ days without login | Monthly churn rate |
| Progress stall > 7 days | Course completion |
| Community drop-off | NPS score |
| Negative support ticket | Revenue retention |

**When to use:** Building health scores, designing alerts.

---

### Cohort Analysis

**Definition:**
Analyzing students grouped by enrollment date to identify patterns.

**Common Cohort Cuts:**
- Enrollment month
- Acquisition channel
- Plan type
- Starting experience level

**What to look for:**
- Activation rates by cohort
- Retention curves over time
- When and where drop-offs happen
- Which cohorts outperform

**Application in Edtech B2C:**
- Compare cohort activation rates
- Identify if specific cohorts have issues
- Measure impact of changes over time

**When to use:** Understanding patterns, measuring initiatives.

---

## Engagement & Community Frameworks

### Community-Led Growth (CLG)

**Definition:**
Using community as a driver of acquisition, retention, and expansion.

**CLG in Edtech:**
- Community IS the product (not just a feature)
- Peer learning often more valuable than content
- Social proof drives both retention and referral

**Key Metrics:**
- Community participation rate
- Peer-to-peer interactions
- User-generated content
- Member-to-member connections

**When to use:** Community strategy, engagement design.

---

### SPACES Model (CMX)

**Six Community Value Types:**

| Value | Description | Edtech Example |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **S**upport | Help and answers | Q&A, troubleshooting |
| **P**roduct | Feedback and ideas | Feature requests, beta testing |
| **A**cquisition | Awareness and leads | Referrals, testimonials |
| **C**ontribution | User-generated content | Shared projects, resources |
| **E**ngagement | Belonging and connection | Events, discussions |
| **S**uccess | Achieving goals | Peer accountability, mentorship |

**Application in Edtech B2C:**
Focus on Support (retention), Engagement (belonging), and Success (outcomes).

**When to use:** Designing community strategy, measuring community value.

---

### Engagement Loops

**Structure:**
```
Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment
   ↑                                      ↓
   ←────────────────────────────────────←
```

**In Edtech:**

| Element | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Trigger | "New module unlocked" notification |
| Action | Complete the module |
| Variable Reward | Badge + random community shoutout |
| Investment | Progress saved, peers see achievement |

**Design Principles:**
- Trigger must be relevant and timely
- Action must be achievable
- Reward must feel earned, not random
- Investment creates switching cost

**When to use:** Designing habit-forming experiences, gamification.

---

## Retention & Expansion Frameworks

### Churn Types

**Voluntary Churn:**
- **Active:** Consciously decides to cancel
- **Passive:** Lets subscription expire, doesn't renew

**Involuntary Churn:**
- Payment failure (card expired, insufficient funds)
- Technical issues

**Hidden Churn:**
- Stops using but doesn't cancel
- Worst type: no feedback, just disengagement

**Treatment by Type:**

| Type | Treatment |
|------|-----------|
| Voluntary Active | Exit interview, address objection |
| Voluntary Passive | Re-engagement before expiry |
| Involuntary | Payment recovery automation |
| Hidden | Proactive detection and intervention |

**When to use:** Churn analysis, prevention strategy design.

---

### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

**Formula:**
```
NRR = (Starting MRR - Churn + Expansion) / Starting MRR × 100
```

**Interpretation:**
- NRR > 100% = Growth from existing customers
- NRR = 100% = Stable (expansion = churn)
- NRR < 100% = Revenue shrinkage

**In Edtech B2C:**
- Expansion = upsells, plan upgrades, additional courses
- Churn = cancellations, non-renewals
- Target: > 100% (expansion offsets churn)

**When to use:** Business health, expansion strategy.

### Win-Back Windows

**Timing Matters:**

| Window | Response Rate | Approach |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| 0-30 days | 15-25% | Address specific churn reason |
| 30-90 days | 10-15% | New value proposition |
| 90-180 days | 5-10% | Fresh start + incentive |
| 180+ days | < 5% | Major update/relaunch only |

**Best Practices:**
- Day 0-7: Acknowledge, don't sell
- Day 14-30: Address specific reason
- Day 60+: New value, not reminder of past

**When to use:** Reactivation campaigns, win-back playbooks.

## Operations Frameworks

### Touch Model Segmentation

**Three Levels:**

| Level | Definition | Student Ratio | Characteristics |
|-------|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Tech-touch | Fully automated | 1:many (500+) | Low-ticket, self-serve |
| Low-touch | Automated + light human | 1:100-500 | Standard journey |
| High-touch | Personal relationship | 1:10-50 | High-ticket, complex |

**In Edtech B2C:**
- Most students = Tech-touch (automation)
- At-risk students = Low-touch (triggered intervention)
- VIP/High-ticket = High-touch (dedicated CS)

**When to use:** Capacity planning, resource allocation.

---

### Capacity Planning

**Variables:**
- Total students per CS person
- Touch model mix
- Complexity of product
- Average interaction time

**Typical Ratios (Edtech B2C):**

| Role | Ratio | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| CS Manager | 1:500-1000 | With automation |
| CS Specialist | 1:200-300 | Low-touch model |
| Success Coach | 1:20-50 | High-touch model |

**When to use:** Team sizing, hiring decisions.

---

### Rituals & Cadences

**Recommended CS Rituals:**

| Ritual | Frequency | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Health Score Review | Daily | Identify at-risk |
| At-Risk Outreach | Daily | Intervene early |
| Cohort Check-in | Weekly | Track activation |
| Churn Analysis | Weekly | Identify patterns |
| Playbook Review | Monthly | Optimize processes |
| NPS Analysis | Quarterly | Strategic insights |

**When to use:** Structuring CS operations, team routines.

## Edtech B2C Reality Checks

### What's Different from Enterprise CS

| Enterprise CS | Edtech B2C |
|---------------|------------|
| Account managers | Automation + triggered human |
| High-touch default | Tech-touch default |
| Renewal meetings | Automated + exception handling |
| QBRs | Progress celebrations |
| Multi-stakeholder | Individual student |
| ROI conversation | Emotional transformation |

### Brazil-Specific Considerations

- **WhatsApp:** Primary channel, 3-5x email engagement
- **Price sensitivity:** Flexible payment, avoid price discussions via automation
- **Trust building:** Proof of value must be fast
- **Seasonality:** Year-end, January, mid-year peaks
- **Personal touch:** Expected even at scale
