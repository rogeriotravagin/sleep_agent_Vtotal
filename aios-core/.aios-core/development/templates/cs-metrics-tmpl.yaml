# Anti-Metrics (What NOT to optimize)
anti_metrics:
  - name: Course completion rate alone
    reason: "Completion ≠ success. Students often get value before completing."

  - name: Vanity engagement metrics
    reason: "Page views without learning outcomes are misleading."

  - name: Support ticket volume (fewer = better)
    reason: "Fewer tickets might mean students gave up, not that they're happy."

  - name: Time on platform alone
    reason: "More time can mean confusion, not engagement."

# Example Output
example_single_metric: |
  # METRIC: Activation Rate (7-Day)

  ## Definition
  Percentage of new students who reach their first meaningful milestone
  within 7 days of enrollment.

  ## Formula
  ```
  (Students reaching Aha Moment in first 7 days / New students enrolled) × 100
  ```

  ## Data Source
  - **Primary:** LMS milestone tracking
  - **Backup:** Manual progress review

  ## Collection
  - **Frequency:** Weekly (per cohort)
  - **Responsibility:** CS Lead
  - **Tool:** LMS Analytics Dashboard

  ## Interpretation
  - **Good:** > 70%
  - **Warning:** 50-70%
  - **Critical:** < 50%

  ## Benchmark
  - **Industry (Edtech B2C):** 60-70%
  - **Our Target:** 75%
  - **Why this target:** Higher activation correlates with 2x retention

  ## Actions

  ### If above target:
  - Document what's working
  - Share success patterns with team
  - Consider raising target

  ### If below target:
  - Immediate: Review onboarding for friction points
  - Short-term: Implement quick-win celebration earlier
  - Investigate: Which segment is underperforming?

  ## Common Pitfalls
  - Defining "Aha Moment" too loosely (e.g., just logging in)
  - Not segmenting by acquisition source
  - Ignoring students who activate late but succeed

  | Support sentiment | 5% | Positive tickets / Total | Help desk |

  ## Overall Calculation
  ```
  Health = (Engagement × 0.40) + (Progress × 0.35) + (Sentiment × 0.25)
  ```

  ## Action Triggers
  | Score | Status | Action |
  |-------|--------|--------|
  | 80-100 | Champion | Advocacy program, testimonial request |
  | 60-79 | Healthy | Standard nurturing, celebrate progress |
