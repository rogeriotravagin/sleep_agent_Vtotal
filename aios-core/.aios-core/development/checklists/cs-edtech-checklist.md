- [ ] Has defined trigger (when playbook activates)
- [ ] Has assigned owner (who executes)
- [ ] Has measurable success metrics

### Actions
- [ ] Each action has specific timing
- [ ] Each action has defined channel
- [ ] Each action has clear owner
- [ ] Actions are executable with current resources
- [ ] Fallback actions defined for critical touchpoints

### Adaptation
- [ ] Adapted for edtech B2C context (not enterprise CS)
- [ ] WhatsApp prioritized as primary channel (Brazil)
- [ ] Considers team capacity and available tools
- [ ] MVP version provided (not over-engineered)

### Framework
- [ ] Reference framework identified
- [ ] Justification provided for framework choice
- [ ] Framework adapted to specific product context

---

## Health Score Validation

### Structure
- [ ] Multiple dimensions defined (engagement, progress, sentiment)
- [ ] Weights add up to 100%
- [ ] Each indicator has clear calculation formula
- [ ] Data sources identified and accessible

### Thresholds
- [ ] Green/Yellow/Red thresholds defined
- [ ] Thresholds are realistic for edtech B2C
- [ ] Action triggers defined for each threshold level

### Implementation
- [ ] Data sources actually available
- [ ] Calculation can be automated (or manual process defined)
- [ ] Update frequency is sustainable
- [ ] Owner assigned for tracking

### Avoiding Anti-Patterns
- [ ] Not relying solely on completion rate
- [ ] Not counting vanity metrics
- [ ] Considering leading indicators, not just lagging
- [ ] Balancing quantitative and qualitative signals

---

## Journey Map Validation

### Overview
- [ ] Product and model clearly defined
- [ ] Desired Outcome articulated (transformation, not features)
- [ ] Aha Moment specifically defined
- [ ] Journey duration realistic

### Stages
- [ ] All critical stages covered
- [ ] Each stage has clear student goal
- [ ] Each stage has clear CS goal
- [ ] Stages flow logically

### Touchpoints
- [ ] Moments of truth identified
- [ ] Touchpoints have timing, channel, owner
- [ ] Mix of automated and human touchpoints
- [ ] Channel priority follows Brazil context (WhatsApp first)

### Signals
- [ ] Success signals defined per stage
- [ ] Risk signals defined per stage
- [ ] Signals are actually observable/measurable
- [ ] Actions defined for both success and risk scenarios

---

## Diagnosis Validation

### Context
- [ ] Product and model documented
- [ ] Current state accurately captured
- [ ] Resources and constraints understood
- [ ] Motivation for diagnosis clear

### Analysis
- [ ] Maturity assessment completed
- [ ] Gaps prioritized (critical vs nice-to-have)
- [ ] Quick wins identified
- [ ] Risks assessed

### Recommendations
- [ ] Phased approach (not all at once)
- [ ] Recommendations match available resources
- [ ] Each recommendation has owner and timeline
- [ ] Success metrics defined for each phase
- [ ] "Not recommended yet" list included

---

## Churn Analysis Validation

### Classification
- [ ] Churn types identified (voluntary/involuntary/hidden)
- [ ] Distribution estimated with evidence
- [ ] Primary churn type prioritized

### Root Cause
- [ ] Multiple root causes considered
- [ ] Framework applied (5 Whys or similar)
- [ ] Causes mapped to evidence/data
- [ ] Root causes prioritized by impact

### Timeline
- [ ] Churn windows identified
- [ ] Critical intervention points defined
- [ ] Causes mapped to timeline

### Strategy
- [ ] Prevention strategy per root cause
- [ ] Intervention playbook for at-risk
- [ ] Win-back strategy with timing windows
- [ ] Metrics to track improvement

---

## General Quality Checks

### Clarity
- [ ] Language is clear and actionable
- [ ] No jargon without explanation
- [ ] Frameworks explained when referenced
- [ ] Next steps explicitly stated

### Pragmatism
- [ ] Solution matches available resources
- [ ] MVP approach taken (essential first)
- [ ] Future evolutions noted but not implemented
- [ ] Quick wins prioritized

### Edtech B2C Adaptation
- [ ] Not copying enterprise CS practices directly
- [ ] Considering high-volume, low-touch reality
- [ ] Prioritizing automation for scale
- [ ] Keeping human touch for critical moments

### Brazil Context
- [ ] WhatsApp as primary channel
- [ ] Price sensitivity considered
- [ ] Trust-building prioritized
- [ ] Sazonality patterns considered

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Over-Engineering
- ❌ Too many metrics (pick 3-5 max)
- ❌ Elaborate frameworks for simple problems
- ❌ Perfect processes instead of working MVPs
- ❌ All phases planned in detail upfront

### Generic Advice
- ❌ "Improve customer experience" without specifics
- ❌ Actions without timing/channel/owner
- ❌ Frameworks without adaptation to context
- ❌ Enterprise CS practices in B2C context

### Unrealistic Expectations
- ❌ Assuming data that doesn't exist
- ❌ Assuming team capacity that isn't there
- ❌ Benchmarks from different contexts
- ❌ All improvements at once
